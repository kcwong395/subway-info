# subway-info
This project aims to tell information regarding subway schedule.

## Requirements:
1. Some method should exist that can tell a caller when the next train will arrive at a specific station, given a time and direction (north, south, east, west).
2. A simple schedule should be implemented, that can be looked up by station, to determine the times at which trains will arrive at that station.
3. As noted above, the data model should account for direction (north, south, east, west) and handle stations that have intersecting lines.
